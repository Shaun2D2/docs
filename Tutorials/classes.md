# Classes Notes

- Access modifiers: 
  - private, 
  - public, 
  - readonly
  - protected (like private but accessible in inherited classes)

- Shortcut to initialize variables in contructor 
  - Constructor(private id: string, private name: string) {}

- Static properties 
  - are not accessible inside class, need to reference the actual class i.e. Department.fiscalYear

- Singleton pattern
  - Set constructor to private and create a static method called getInstance() (name does not matter).  This does a check to see if there is an instance of the calls on a static variable (example `private static instance`).
